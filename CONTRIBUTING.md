Contributing
=============================

So you want to contribute, huh? Well, thank you very much! :)

### I'm feeling brave enough to make changes to the code directly

Great, if you feel comfortable to make the changes directly to the code, simply fork this repo and create a 
[pull request](https://github.com/MisterPhilip/universal-analytics-migration/pulls) with the changes. 
Once that is done, I'll review the changes to make sure they are accurate & nothing is broken. I'll either accept the request and update 
the site, or reply within the pull request if there are any changes that should be made. 

The site uses [trq/Gen](https://github.com/trq/Gen) to build the pages.

### I'm not up to messing with code today

No worries, simply open a [new ticket](https://github.com/MisterPhilip/universal-analytics-migration/issues/new) with the typo or addition you'd like to make, and I'll add it in for you.
