Migrating to Universal Analytics
=============================

This is the source for the [Universal Analytics Migration Guide](http://misterphilip.com/universal-analytics/migration). 

Universal Analytics is the newest version of [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/). In fact, it is so new, it's still in beta! 
A few great new features:

 * New, faster code
 * Simplified interface & configuration
 * Migrated from custom variables to custom metrics & dimensions (and gave more of each!)
 * Better cross-platform tracking

It's recommended to run Universal Analytics in conjunction with Google Analytics and to not completely replace Google Analytics.
